# double_pipe_heat_exchanger
This project focuses on developing a computational model to analyze heat transfer mechanisms in a double-pipe heat exchanger, with emphasis on both radiative and convective heat transfer. The model evaluates local temperature and heat transfer profiles for co-current and counter-current flows, providing insights into optimizing energy efficiency in industrial systems.
